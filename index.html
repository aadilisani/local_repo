Question 1:What is Git?What it is used.
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code.
Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files and coordinate works among multiple contributors.
It is used to managed source code,track project history,facilitate collaboration, and enable branching and merging workflows.
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration and code sharing. 
Question 2: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Answer- Git and GitHub is that Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud. Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.
Question 3: What is a repository in Git?
A repository, or repo, is a centralized digital storage that developers use to make and manage changes to an application's source code. A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
 Question 4: How do you create a new Git repository?
 To create a new Git repository, you can either initialize a new, empty repository in a directory using git init or clone an existing repository using git clone. 
 1. Creating a new, empty repository (using git init):
Step 1: Create a directory for your project: Navigate to the location where you want to create your project directory and create a new folder (e.g., my-project). 
Step 2: Open the directory in Git Bash (or your terminal): Open a terminal or Git Bash and navigate to the newly created directory. 
Step 3: Run git init: Type git init in the terminal and press Enter. This command initializes a new, empty Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git folder. 
Step 4: Add files and folders to your project 
Step 5: Routinely stage files and create commits 
2. Cloning an existing repository (using git clone):
Step 1: Obtain the URL of the repository you want to clone: This could be a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository URL. 
Step 2: Open a terminal or Git Bash and navigate to the desired location: Choose where you want to create the local copy of the repository. 
Step 3: Run git clone <repository_URL>: Type git clone followed by the repository URL and press Enter. This command creates a local copy of the repository in a new directory with the same name as the repository. 
 Question 5: Explain the difference between a Git commit and a Git push.
 Git a source code management?
Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is also synonymous with Version control.
 A repository contains all of your project's files, revision history, and collaborator discussion.
